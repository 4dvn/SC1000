# MIDI Mapping - format is :
# Status,channel,data,action
# 
# Status can be : 
# 8 - Note OFF (will also match zero-velocity Note ON)
# 9 - Note ON
# 11 - Control Change
# 14 - Pitch Bend
#
# Channel is the MIDI channel of the incoming MIDI message
#
# Data is the note or CC number
#
# Action can be (replace x with 0 for beats or 1 for samples) :
# CHx_CUE - Set and trigger cue points
# CHx_SHIFTON - Activate shift mode (ignores x)
# CHx_SHIFTOFF - Deactivate shift mode (also ignores x)
# CHx_STARTSTOP - Start or Stop the track
# PITCH - Change the speed of the track
# NOTEy - Change the pitch musically, replace y with the note number (60 being 0%)

# Hold down shift and a cue button to delete a cue point

# Here's an annotated example for my Akai MPD18
# Which has 16 pads from C2(36) to Eb3(51)
# And a fader on CC #0

#Bottom 2 rows (8 pads) are cue points for track 1 (samples)
