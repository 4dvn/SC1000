This is a board to convert the v0.1 PCB to v0.2 by adding the required filters to the audio outputs.

It just solders directly underneath the 3.5mm audio jack.

You probably want to order it in thinner-than-normal PCB material (0.6 worked for me) and make sure your fab house can do castellated holes.
