The folders are as follows : 
* **Firmware** - Source code for the input processor. This handles the pots, switches and capacitive touch sensor, and passes the information on to the main processor.
* **Software** - Source code for the modified version of xwax running on the main SoC.
* **Hardware** (coming soon) - Gerbers and Altium source files for the main PCB and enclosure (which is made of PCBs)
